##Hello ThereðŸ‘‹

I'm Omphile from South Africa, and I do Web Design, Blockchain Development as well as Game Development
I really enjoy exploring and learning languages and frameworks like JS , C# , Solidity , Nodejs, Reactjs. 
For Game Design I have worked with Unity and Blender but I am looking forward to learning more environments and tools.
I look forward to mastering my skills and keep on making contributions to the tech community.
